//! Every guessing strategy in the project goes here.
//!
//! A strategy plays one whole game. It is handed a secret keeper and a range, it
//! asks whatever questions it likes, and it returns the number it has worked out.
//! They differ in which questions they ask.
//!
//! Two types of questions are available:
//!
//!   keeper.ask_if_equal(n)     is it exactly n?
//!   keeper.ask_if_greater(n)   is it bigger than n? (no means less or equal)
